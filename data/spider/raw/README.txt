# 06/01/2020 updated: corrected ~40 annotation errors/mismatches in dev.json



This folder contains the Spider training and dev data sets for the EMNLP 2018 paper Spider: A Large-Scale Human-Labeled Dataset for Complex and Cross-Domain Semantic Parsing and Text-to-SQL Task.

It contains the following files:

- train_spider.json
	# Training Examples: 7000
	# Databases:		 140
- train_others.json
	# Training Examples: 1659
	# Databases:		 6
- dev.json
	# Training Examples: 1034
	# Databases:		 20
- tables.json
	# Databases: 	     166
- dev_gold.sql
- train_gold.sql
- database/
- README.txt

The official final Spider training data set combines train_spider.json and train_others.json.
The databases used in train_others.json are from Restaurants, GeoQuery, Scholar, Academic, IMDB, and Yelp which are prepared by Finegan-Dollak et al., 2018.
The databases and SQL examples in train_spider.json are originally prepared by us.
For the format of each json file, please refer to our github page https://github.com/taoyds/spider.
In database/, there is one folder for each database which contains the [db_name].sqlite file.
For most databases, we also provide a schema.sql file with SQL statements to create the database.

If you use the dataset, please cite the following papers including Finegan-Dollak et al., 2018 and the original datasets for Restaurants, GeoQuery, Scholar, Academic, IMDB, and Yelp.
